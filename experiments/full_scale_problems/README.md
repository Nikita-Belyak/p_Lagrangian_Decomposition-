The folder contains the formulations of the full-scale problems as .txt files 

Each filename is of the following format "full_scale_**1#**_**2#** _**3#**_**4#**_(**5#**).txt" where **1#**, **2#**, **3#**, **4#** and **5#** correspond to the following parameters used to generate the MIQCQP instances

* **1#** is the number that corresponds to the number of scenarios
* **2#** is the number that corresponds to the number of the continuous decision variables per scenario
* **3#** is the number that corresponds to the number of the integer decision variables per scenario
* **4#** is the number that corresponds to the number of the constraints per scenario
* **5#** is the number that corresponds to the state of a random function used to generate same random numbers on multiple executions
